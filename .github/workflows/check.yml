# TODO: try to improve caching.

# We spend a lot of time fetching sources. Caching all of ~/.cache/nix/gitv3 is
# not ideal (it is likely too large).
# https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache/issues/28 may help.

# This might get better as the cache populates, as long as I don't hit size
# limits.
